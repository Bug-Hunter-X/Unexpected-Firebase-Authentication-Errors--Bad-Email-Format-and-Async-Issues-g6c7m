# Firebase Authentication Error Handling
This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios encountered while using the Firebase Authentication SDK in JavaScript applications. The first scenario involves the SDK failing silently when users enter invalid email addresses (missing '@' symbol or domain). The second scenario showcases challenges in managing asynchronous operations within the Firebase SDK, leading to potential unexpected behavior. The provided code samples highlight these issues and offer solutions for improved error handling and robust application behavior.
