The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email is not properly formatted. For instance, if a user tries to sign up with an email address that is missing the '@' symbol or the domain, the SDK might not return an informative error message, making debugging challenging.  This can lead to silent failures where the user interface doesn't reflect the actual sign-up failure. Another uncommon issue is related to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations. If you're not handling promises and async/await correctly when interacting with Firebase services, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors that are hard to trace.
